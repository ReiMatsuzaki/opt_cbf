* Refactoring opt.[ch]pp
  extract these classes to new namespace named Optimizer.

* Refactoring Restrict.[ch]pp
  Now name convention is not good.
  Introduce two variable space such that
  Normal space: original variables (i.e. x0, x1, x2, ..., xN)
  Restricted space: restricted variables (i.e. x0 and ratio)
  
* Refactoring KeysValues
  Current code has multiplicity for example
  template<class T> .....
  template<class T, class V> .....
  template<class T, class V, class U> .....
  These code have many overlap and can be removed
  by some technique in meta programming.
